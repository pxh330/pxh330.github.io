<br><br><strong>The First Time</strong>
&#160;U2<br><br>
I have a lover<br>
A lover like no other<br>
She got soul, soul, soul, sweet soul<br>
And she teach me how to sing<br>
Shows me colors when there's none to see<br>
Gives me hope when I can't believe<br>
That for the first time<br>
I feel loved<br><br>
I have a brother<br>
When I'm a brother in need<br>
I spend my whole time running<br>
He spends his running after me<br>
When I feel myself going down<br>
I just call and he comes around<br>
But for the first time<br>
I feel love<br><br>
My father is a rich man<br>
He wears a rich man's cloak<br>
Gave me the keys to his kingdom coming<br>
Gave me a cup of gold<br>
He said I have many mansions<br>
And there are many rooms to see<br>
But I left by the back door<br>
And I threw away the key<br>
And I threw away the key<br>
Yeah, I threw away the key<br>
Yeah, I threw away the key<br><br></p></div>
